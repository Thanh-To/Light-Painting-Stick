# Light-Painting-Stick

1. Overview

    This project is inspired by Adafruit's NeoPixel Painter (https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixel-painter). While the hardware is     similar, the software is completely re-written for improved ease of use, simplied code and wider support of image file extensions. In     this project, an image file is converted to an array of RGB values in a txt file using a Processing sketch. The the Arduino will read     the text file and display them on the RGB LED strip.
